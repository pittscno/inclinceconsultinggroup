                                        <p>Erin is a senior majoring in Industrial Engineering and this will be her third semester with Incline Consulting Group. In addition to Incline, she is co-oping at FedEx Supply Chain as a part of the Project Engineering Team and she is the Vice President of the University of Pittsburgh’s chapter of the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers. Erin has greatly enjoyed the projects she has been a part of through Incline not only because it allows her to learn more about and to expand her knowledge in consulting, but Incline also provides the opportunity to give back to the Pittsburgh community in a unique way. She is excited to continue her time at Incline in her new role as Vice President of Public Relations.</p>
